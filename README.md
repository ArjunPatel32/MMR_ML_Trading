# Momentum and Mean Reversion Trading with ML 

Project by Arjun Patel

- Generate momentum and mean reversion signals
- Label which one would have been better historically.
- Train a model on features to predict that label.
- At run‚Äêtime, pick the signals from the approach the model favors.
- Apply stop-loss risk management to the signals
- Compare to holding the S&P 500 and holding an equal portfolio across all tickers.
- Run simulations of random stocks with strategy

TODO:
- implement transaction fees
