# Momentum and Mean Reversion Trading with ML 

Project by Arjun Patel

- Generate momentum and mean reversion signals
- Label which one would have been better historically.
- Train a model on features to predict that label.
- At run‚Äêtime, pick the signals from the approach the model favors.
- Apply stop-loss risk management to the signals
- Compare to holding the S&P 500 and holding an equal portfolio across all tickers.

TODO:
- implement transaction fees
- random sample of companies in S&P
- able to change the start date to before a stock went public and still works
